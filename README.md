This project was done during spring semester 2024, in Sharif University of Technology.
The project consists of two phases, each has a related folder. in each folder there's a description file of the project and a report file in .pdf format.
every other related file is uploaded in the ralated folder, according to descriptions in report file.

NOTE: The report files are written in Persian language. There's a chance I translate them to english in a distant future :)
